# dikonakaya — Developer Portfolio (Starter Template)

This is a starter template generated for the user **dikonakaya**.
Tech stack (locked): **React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 + Framer Motion**
Design: **Dark-only, Clean Developer Aesthetic**
Architecture: **Feature-based**

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes & Next Steps

- Tailwind v4 does not require `tailwind.config.js` or `npx tailwindcss init -p`. You can use Tailwind by importing it in your main CSS (already done in `src/index.css`).
- This template includes minimal components and a `Hero` feature as an example.
- ShadCN UI components are *not* pre-generated here; if you want I can add a few ShadCN components (button, card, nav) in a follow-up commit — ShadCN often requires specific setup choices and copyable component code.
- ESLint and Prettier config files are minimal; extend them to match your team's rules.

## Deploy

This repo is Vercel-ready. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel and it will deploy automatically. Configure your custom domain in Vercel dashboard when you're ready.

---

If you want, I can:
- Add full ShadCN UI components now,
- Add Projects, About, Contact sections with sample data,
- Initialize a GitHub repository and push the code for you (I can provide step-by-step commands).
